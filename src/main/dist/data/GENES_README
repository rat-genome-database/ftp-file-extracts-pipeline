RGD GENES_xxx readme file.
Last updated - February 2017

contact: rgd.developers@mcw.edu

GENERAL INFORMATION:

GENES_xxx files contain up-to-date information for rat, mouse and human genes found in RGD database.
Genomic positions are provided for both the current and the previous reference assemblies, as well as for Celera alternate assembly.
Leftmost columns are in common for both files. Last columns contain species-specific information.
GENES_xxx files are in tab delimited format.
Within a tab delimited field multiple values are now separated by a semicolon ";" instead of a comma "," or bar "|".
This is to improve rendering of the files when viewed in Excel.

MAIN CHANGES (compared with previous version):

- Removed GDB_ID column.
- Genomic positions are now given for reference assemblies specific for given species.
- GENES_MOUSE provides information about MGD IDs and cM positions.
- GENES_HUMAN provides information about HPRD IDs, HGNC IDs and OMIM IDs.
- RATMAP_ID and RHDB_ID columns for RAT are discontinued -- blanks will be used for compatibility.

GENES_OBSOLETE_IDS.txt
----------------------

GENES_OBSOLETE_IDS.txt contains a list of the genes in the RGD database which have been either WITHDRAWN or RETIRED
(designated as "OLD_GENE" in the list).  In RGD, a gene is "WITHDRAWN" when the record is no longer active
and has not been replaced by or merged into another gene record.  A gene is "RETIRED" when the gene has been merged
into another record so that the second record (i.e. the "NEW_GENE") is considered "a replacement for" or "equivalent to"
the retired one.  In some cases, the "NEW_GENE" may have subsequently also been retired or withdrawn, in which case
a second line where this is designated as the "OLD_GENE" will also appear in the file.  An example appears below
the list of column headers.  This file is updated approximately weekly to reflect an up-to-date list of the obsoletions.

Columns in the GENES_OBSOLETE_IDS.txt are as follows:

#COLUMN INFORMATION:
#1 SPECIES name of the species
#2 OLD_GENE_RGD_ID old gene RGD ID
#3 OLD_GENE_SYMBOL old gene symbol
#4 OLD_GENE_STATUS old gene status
#5 OLD_GENE_TYPE old gene type
#6 NEW_GENE_RGD_ID new gene RGD ID (if any)
#7 NEW_GENE_SYMBOL new gene symbol (if any)
#8 NEW_GENE_STATUS old gene status (if any)
#9 NEW_GENE_TYPE new gene type (if any)

Example lines:
WITHDRAWN GENE:
rat 2005 A39_mapped WITHDRAWN mapped

RETIRED GENE:
rat 2008 Abl1_mapped RETIRED mapped 1584969 Abl1 ACTIVE protein-coding

NEW_GENE SUBSEQUENTLY WITHDRAWN:
rat 2105 Amd3 RETIRED gene 2106 Amd-ps_mapped WITHDRAWN mapped
rat 2106 Amd-ps_mapped WITHDRAWN mapped


GENES_ALLELES.txt and GENES_SPLICES.txt
---------------------------------------

The GENES_RAT.txt file does not contain information about gene alleles or splice variants.  These records
can be found in the GENES_ALLELES.txt and GENES_SPLICES.txt files, respectively.  Columns in these files
contain headers, indicating the type of data in each column.  These files contain map data for all three
currently used rat genome assemblies, RGSC 3.4, 5.0 and 6.0, but unlike records in the GENES_RAT.txt,
each row in the allele or splice file contains only one map position with the assembly specified in column 9
(i.e. for a gene allele which maps to all three assemblies, there will be three rows in the GENES_ALLELES.txt file:
a row containing the v3.4 position of the gene, a row for the v5.0 position and a row for the v6.0 position,
with all other data the same between those rows.)
