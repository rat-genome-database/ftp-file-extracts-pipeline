RGD QTLS readme file.
Last updated - Oct 2014

contact: rgd.developers@mcw.edu

In addition to QTLS_RAT and QTLS_HUMAN files, we are providing QTLS_MOUSE file.
Mouse QTLs at RGD are downloaded from the Mouse Genome Informatics ftp site
(http://www.informatics.jax.org/downloads/reports/index.html) on a weekly basis.
We are providing qtl positions on current and older genomic maps, if available.
The files are tab-delimited data, one row per QTL record.

MAIN CHANGES:

- Separate files for rat, human and mouse QTLS.
- Separate columns for mapping data on the 3.4, 5.0 and 6.0 rat genome assemblies.
- Additional columns specify the method of positioning of the QTL on the genome assembly (see below for details).
- Columns specific to only one species are only included in that species' file.  Leftmost columns are in common for both files.  See below for specific information on column contents.
- Within a tab delimited field multiple values are now separated by a semicolon ";" instead of a comma ",". This is to improve rendering of the files when viewed in Excel.
- RATMAP_ID column is obsolete as of April 1, 2011 and it will be filled with blanks for compatibility
- As of April 2013, rgd ids and symbol of crossed rat strains are given in separate columns, for easier sorting


POSITIONING METHODS:

A QTL is positioned on a genome assembly by using the flanking and peak markers as provided by the paper detailing the QTL. 

For each assembly there are four columns in the QTL file, e.g. for the rat 3.4 assembly:
3.4_MAP_POS_CHR	- the chromosome, this may in rare cases, due to assembly differences, not match the chromosome given in the column "CHROMOSOME_FROM_REF" which is curated from the original paper.
3.4_MAP_POS_START - the start position, always for the + strand 
3.4_MAP_POS_STOP - the stop position, always for the + strand
3.4_MAP_POS_METHOD - see below

To be used a marker must map to exactly one location on a given assembly and be on the same chromosome as the other markers used for that QTL

Ideally both flanking markers are used. If that is not possible a flank and a peak marker are used and the QTL
is estimated to be symmetrical about the peak. If that is not possible the peak alone is used with an estimated
QTL size about the peak (see below for information on size estimation). Finally if only one flank is available
that is used with an estimated size extending from that flank (there may be directionality errors for this case
as correct orientation can not be ensured in the absence of another marker). All estimates are bounded by the chromosome sizes.

There is therefore a hierarchy of confidence in QTL position:
1 - by flanking markers
2 - by one flank and peak markers
3 - by peak only
4 - by one flank marker only
5 - by peak marker with size adjusted to avg qtl size for species
6 - position imported from external source

Which method is used is listed in the column xxx_MAP_POS_METHOD.
Users wishing the highest quality data may wish to filter only for case 1, or case 1 and 2.

In the event that no position can be assigned to a QTL on a given assembly the positioning fields are left blank.

QTL size estimates:
Until such time as we have better methods to alternatively position uncertain markers the QTL size estimates used
for "3 - by peak only" and "4 - by one flank marker only" are made from the global distribution of known QTL sizes for the given species.

For human our current estimated QTL size is: 26 Mbp
For mouse our current estimated QTL size is: 34 Mbp
For rat our current estimated QTL size is: 45 Mbp
