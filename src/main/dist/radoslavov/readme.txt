This pipeline was originally running on the text mining application server MORGAN, and later on GREEN.
In 2019 GREEN server has been replaced by GARAK.

The pipeline looks to be obsolete. The files it generates are copied to HORAN and OSLER servers,
but 'data release' no longer uses these servers to copy these files to RGD FTP server.

The last files originated from this pipeline that are found on RGD FTP site are from Dec 2015.
Since we did not receive any user feedback requesting an update of these files, we can assume,
that these files are no longer needed, so the pipeline could be retired.

For reference, we save the original scripts from GREEN server in this directory.
